This is the textual form of the FusionDirectory FAQ.

Q: When creating many users for one department, I need to fill some
   fields again and again. Is there a shortcut for that?

A: Just create a user template and pre-fill all values you need. You
   can use dynamic content, too: uid, sn and givenName will be replaced.
   i.E. an entry '/home/%uid' in homeDirectory will be replaced by the
   real uid of the user you're creating, %sn.%givenName@yourdomain.com
   creates proper email addresses, etc. Templates include group membership.


Q: Can FusionDirectory execute commands after creating/editing/removing users,
   departments, etc.

A: Yes. Edit /etc/fusiondirectory/fusiondirectory.conf's menu section. Each plugin
   have an entry "postremove", "postmodify" and "postcreate".  You can use ldap
   attributes as command line options.
   i.E. postcreate="/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/sbin/ftp.setperms %uid '%givenName'"


Q: I'd like to  modify the look of FusionDirectory to fit our CI. How can I create an
   own theme?

A: Themes are splitted into two parts. ihtml/ contains templates which
   generate the ui, html/ contains all parts that must be readable from
   clients. FusionDirectory first looks for predefined files in the directory indirectly
   defined via the "theme" parameter in /etc/fusiondirectory/fusiondirectory.conf. If it
   can't find them here, it'll use the default one.

   So start over by copying html/themes/default to html/themes/yourtheme
   and ihtml/themes/default to ihtml/themes/yourtheme. Change fusiondirectory.conf to
   contain theme="yourtheme" in section main. Here are some files to edit:

   * login.tpl          -> login screen
   * framework.tpl	-> page contents
   * style.css          -> stylesheets used by FusionDirectory
 

Q: How can I let a person do administrative tasks under a specific department?

   FusionDirectory 1.0 implements a more flexible but complex ACL management, please have a look at 
   the following wiki page: https://oss.gonicus.de/labs/gosa/wiki/DocumentationWritingACLs2.6
   If you have still questions, please use the mailing list or the forum.
   

Q: How can I permit users to change some of their own attributes?

A: Same like described above, but additionally you have to check the option 
   'Apply this acl only for users own entries'.
   (For versions 1.0.x, see the wiki pages)


Q: What about applications?

A: FusionDirectory can manage desktop applications in ldap. Create a group and put all users
   in there, which have common desktop settings. Go to the "Application" tab and
   add all applications common to this group. Applications can be created from the
   application plugin.
   The idea behind this feature is a script running on the terminal-servers/
   workstation which check for applications on login (or on a regular basis using
   timestamps). This one will create the corresponding icons on your KDE or GNOME
   desktop.


Q: What's this terminal stuff?

A: GOto is - similar to LTSP - a ldap based diskless client system. It is available
   from our projects page.


Q: I can't select any mailservers. What's wrong?

A: It seems that a mail server is missing in your configuration.
   Create a new server, go to the services tab and add the imap service.
   For more details, please have a look at the FAQ and wiki pages. 
   (This may differ in older FusionDirectory versions)


Q: FusionDirectory is not in my native language, can I translate it to my language?

A: Yes. Just go to the locale directory and copy the messages.po file somewhere
   else. Edit the copy and put your translations into the msgstr lines. To be
   included in next FusionDirectory releases, you may want to send it to the FusionDirectory maintainer.
   Finally you need to create a directory with your language code. (i.e. de for
   german) containing the LC_MESSAGES directory. Move your messages.po file there
   and run 'msgfmt messages.po' in that directory. That's it.

   You may need to restart apache, depending on your setup. On Debian, be sure
   to have your locale generated (dpkg-reconfigure locales) before.


Q: The online help doesn't exist in my language, can i translate it to my language?

A: Yes. Just go to the doc/guide/user/en directory and copy the lyx-source directory
   to a new directory in doc/guide/user/<your language>. You have to use the lyx
   program create the online help in your language. When you have finish just run
   ./update_online_help from the FusionDirectory root directory to generate the
   online docs.

   
Q: Can I specify some kind of password policies?

A: You can place the keywords "passwordMinLength" and "passwordMinDiffer" in the main
   section of your fusiondirectory.conf. "passwordMinLength" specifies how many characters a
   password must have to be accepted. "passwordMinDiffer" contains the number of
   characters that must be different from the previous password.

   Note that these only affect passwords that are set by the user, not by the admins.


Q: I've to update passwords on external windows PDCs. Can I add a command to let
   synchronize these for me?

A: There's the possibility to add a password hook in fusiondirectory.conf's main section using
   the keyword "passwordHook". The specified command will be executed with 
   three parameters: /path/to/your/script username oldpassword newpassword

   So you can call i.e. smbpasswd to handle your password change on the PDC.


Q: What about templates for vacation messages?

A: Create a directory to keep a set of vacation messages which are readable by the
   user that runs your apache. In this example I'll use /var/cache/fusiondirectory/vacation for that.

   Put your vacation files in there containing a "DESC:some descriptive text" as the
   first line followed by the normal vacation text. You can use all attributes from
   the generic tab. I.e.:

    /var/cache/fusiondirectory/vacation/business.txt 

   |--> 
    DESC:Away from desk
    Hi, I'm currently away from my desk. You can contact me on
    my cell phone via %mobile.
    
    Greetings,
    %givenName %sn
   |<--
 
   Place the config option vacationTemplateDirectory="/var/cache/fusiondirectory/vacation" in the location found in
   fusiondirectory.conf and a template box is show in the vacation mail tab.


Q: How can I generate automatic ID's for user templates?

A: Add an entry describing your id policy in fusiondirectory.conf, location section:

   a) using attributes
      You can specify LDAP attributes (currently only sn and givenName) in braces {}
      and add a percent sign befor it. Optionally you can strip it down to a number
      of characters, specified in []. I.e.

   |--> 
      idGenerator="{%sn}-{%givenName[2-4]}"
   |<--

      will generate an ID using the full surname, adding a dash, and adding at least
      the first two characters of givenName. If this ID is used, it'll use up to four
      characters. If no automatic generation is possible, a input box is shown.

   b) using automatic id's
      I.e. specifying

   |--> 
      idGenerator="acct{id:3}"
   |<--

      will generate a three digits id with the next free entry appended to "acct".

   |--> 
      idGenerator="ext{id#3}"
   |<--

      will generate a three digits random number appended to "ext".


Q: I'm migrating from the current LDAP, now FusionDirectory does not allow uid's and group
   with upper/lower case and spaces. What can I do?

A: Include the strictNamingRules="no" keyword in your fusiondirectory.conf's location section.
   WARNING: using strictNamingRules="no" will cause problems with cyrus/postfix!!


Q: I'd like to place my users under ou=staff, not under ou=people. Can I change
   this?

A: Yes. You can change the people and group locations by adding the following
   statements to your location sections:

   |--> 
   userRDN="ou=staff"
   groupRDN="ou=crowds"
   |<--

   After logging in again, people and groups are created in the configured places.
   As a side note, you can leave these strings blank for flat structures, too.


Q: I've problems with many objectClass violations/undefined attributes. Can FusionDirectory
   check what's missing?

A: Yes. Move away your fusiondirectory.conf and go to the FusionDirectory setup. Follow the steps till
   you can download the config. If you get up to this point, your schema is ok...


Q: I really don't want dn's containing the CN for user accounts because I don't
   want to support anonymous binds for uid resolution. Is it possible to have dn's
   containing the uid instead?

A: Yes. Placing the accountPrimaryAttribute="uid" keyword in your fusiondirectory.conf's location
   section will solve your problem.


Q: Hey, I've installed FusionDirectory, but it claims something about "SID and / or RIDBASE
   are missing in your configuration". What's wrong?

A: You've configured FusionDirectory to use samba3, but your LDAP has no samba domain object
   inside. Either log into samba for the first time to let it create that object,
   or supply the sid and ridbase for your domain in your fusiondirectory.conf's location, i.e.:

   |--> 
   <location name=...>
             ...
             sambaRidBase="1000"
             sambaSID="0-815-4711" \>
   |<--

   Remember to fill in your real domain sid which is retrievable by the command
   "net getlocalsid".


Q: We have massive performance problems with using samba as a member server.

A: This is a known issue. We're working around this by putting

   |--> 
   <location name=...>
    ...
    sambaIdMapping="true"
    ... \>
   |<--

    into the configuration. FusionDirectory will write the additional objectClass sambaIdmapEntry
    to the group and user objects.


Q: I get 'The value specified as GID/UID number is too small' when forcing IDs. Why?

A: This is an additional security feature, so that no one can fall back to uid 0. The
   default minimum ID is 100. You can set it to every value you like by specifying

   |--> 
   <location name=...>
    ...
    minId="40"
    ... \>
   |<--

   in your configuration. In this example 40 will be the smallest ID you can enter.


Q: Aahhrg. I've updated to a new version and my fusiondirectory.conf seems to be broken.

A: Some parameters may have changed. Please move your fusiondirectory.conf away and re-run the setup.


Q: I've saved my windows workstations in other locations like FusionDirectory is doing it
   for decades. Is there a way to change this?

A: Yes. Use the winstation parameter in your location section: 

   |--> 
   <location name=...>
   ...
   sambaMachineAccountRDN="ou=machineaccounts"
   ... \>
   |<--


Q: FusionDirectory doesn't seem to follow my referrals. What can I do?

A: Place the option 'ldapFollowReferrals = "true"' inside your locations definition
   and you should be fine.


Q: I'd like to have TLS based LDAP connections from within FusionDirectory. Is this possible?

A: Yes, add

   |--> 
   <location ...>
   ...
         ldapTLS="true"
   ... \>
   |<--

   to the location section of FusionDirectory. This switch affects LDAP connections for a single location only.


Q: Cyrus folder get created in the style user.username. I prefer the unix hirachy
   style user/username. Is it possible to change this?

A: Yes, add

   |--> 
   <location
	...
    cyrusUseSlashes="true"
   |<--

   to the location or main section of FusionDirectory and the folders are created in unix style.


Q: I've a cyrus installation with customized user and folder prefixes. 
   How can I tell FusionDirectory to use the prefixes I prefer?

A: Simply set the following attributes in the location tag of your fusiondirectory.conf:  

   |--> 
   <location 
	...
    mailUserCreation="myprefix/%mail%"
    mailFolderCreation="myfolder\\.%cn%@%domain%"
   |<--

   The dot in the above example is escaped to prevent it from replacing with '/' if 
    cyrusUseSlashes is set to true.

   You can use the following replacements:
   |--> 
    %cn%       - The groups cn.
    %uid%      - The users uid.
    %prefix%   - The default prefix used by the mailmethod.
    %uattrib%  - The configured mailAttribute="" (fusiondirectory.conf).
    %domain%   - The domain part of the given mail address. (user@domain.com = domain.com)
    %mailpart% - The user part of the mail address. (user@domain.com = user)
    %mail%     - The complete mail address. 
   |<--


Q: I want to use cyrus for multiple mail domains, but FusionDirectory uses the 'uid' attribute for account namens, how do I change this to 'mail'?

A: Just add/modify the following line to/in your fusiondirectory.conf:

   |--> 
   <location 
    ...
    mailAttribute="mail"
   |<--


Q: I'd like to do special checks for several plugin parameters. How can I modify
   FusionDirectory to take care of these checks?

A: No need to modify anything. Just add a hook the the plugin you'd like to
   check:

   |--> 
    check="/your/command/binary"
   |<--

   This binary will get an ldif to STDIN for analysis and may write an error message
   to STDOUT. Note, that the supplied ldif may NOT be the original target ldif due
   to technical reasons.


Q: Is there a way to use ACL independet filtering when using administrative units?

A: Yes. Set "honourUnitTags" to "true" in your fusiondirectory.conf's location section.


Q: How can i active the account expiration code for the FusionDirectory interface?

A: Yes. Just set "handleExpiredAccounts" to "true" in your fusiondirectory.conf's main section.


Q: What is the correct connection string for a Kolab server in FusionDirectory?

A: Try {localhost:143/novalidate-cert}.


Q: Sieve is not working from FusionDirectory - there are authentication problems
   with this service, IMAP/POP is working. What's wrong?

A: Verify that the paramater sasl_auto_transition: no is not
   present in your imap.conf


Q: I have a SIEVE problem - "Can't log into SIEVE server. Server  says //. -

A: Probably something is wrong with the authentification which is used by timesieved.
   - Check if you can login with "sieveshell" on this host.
   - Also check "telnet localhost 2000" - Is there any output about "Plain Login"?

   Please verify the ldap imap attributes, like goImapSieveServer and goImapSievePort. 
   These value can be modified using the server->services tab in FusionDirectory 1.0

   Here is an older, but maybe helpful solution for Cyrus-Imapd 2.1.5 on SuSE 9.0:
   - Install the "cyrus-sasl-plain" rpm from the distro-cd (This packet contains "sasl2/libplain" library).
   - Modify your /etc/imap.conf:

   |--> 
    sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
    sasl_mech_list: plain login
   |<--

   - Modify your /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd:

   |--> 
    SASLAUTHD_AUTHMECH=pam
   |<--


Q: Slapd does not start with kolab2.schema included. It claims that the
   definition of calFBURL is missing. What can I do?

A: For Kolab to work correctly you have to include the rfc2739.schema
   in your slapd.conf. Insert it before the kolab2.schema


Q: New implementations of OpenLDAP seem to require {sasl} instead of {kerberos}
   in password hashes. FusionDirectory writes the wrong string. What can I do?

A: You can set "useSaslForKerberos" to "true" in your fusiondirectory.conf's main section.


Q: Is there a way to add the personalTitle attribute the the users dn?

A: Just add this line into the location section of your fusiondirectory.conf.

   |--> 
   <location
    ... 
    personalTitleInDN="true"
   |<--


Q: I'd like to assign different uid bases for certain user/group objects.
   How can this be achieved?

A: Use the 'baseIdHook' in your fusiondirectory.conf's location section to specify a script
   which handles the ID generation externaly. It get's called with the "dn"
   and the attribute to be ID'd. It should return an integer value.


Q: I'd like to use rfc2307bis compliant groups. Is this possible?

A: Yes - place the rfc2307bis="true" inside of the location section of
   your fusiondirectory.conf. Remember, that you can't create empty groups in this mode.


Q: Can FusionDirectory show some vendor information for given MAC addresses?

A: Yes. Download http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt and place
   it in /etc/fusiondirectory/oui.txt.


Q: FusionDirectory sessions expire too quick. Is there a way to change this?

A: Yes. Set "sessionLifetime" to the number of seconds of inactivity. 7200
   (60x60x2) would be for two hours. Place this option inside the main
   section of your fusiondirectory.conf.


Q: Microsoft Internet Explorer <=6 seems paints strange blocks around
   images.

A: Use Firefox, Konqueror, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer >= 8, etc.
   Internet explorer 6 is broken and we don't want to waste time
   to make FusionDirectory work with defective browsers

Q: Is there a way to let users change passwords without logging into FusionDirectory?

A: Yes. Browse to "password.php". You can preset a couple of things i.e.:

   |--> 
    http://your.admin.server/password.php?uid=cajus&method=md5&directory=GONICUS+GmbH
   |<--


Q: FusionDirectory only shows 300 entries at a time. Is this normal?

A: There's a default sizelimit. You can set the "ldapSizelimit" option in your
   fusiondirectory.conf's  location section to a higher value to get rid of it.


Q: I have problems with my ldap server when I open groups with 
   a huge amount of members, what can I do?

A: You can set a nesting limit which ensures that the user names will not be 
   resolved if the amount of members reaches this limit.

   |--> 
    <location
     ...
     ldapFilterNestingLimit="100"
   |<--


Q: I want to disable the "Is the configuration file up to date?" check when logging in.
   How can I disable this check?

A: Just set the configVersion attribute to an empty value:

   |--> 
    <conf configVersion="" >
   |<--


Q: I've shredded my access control and am not able to do anything from now on. Is there
   a way to override the ACL?

A: Yes. Insert the following statement in the location section of your fusiondirectory.conf:

   |--> 
    ignoreAcl="your user's dn"
   |<--


Q: I can't logon as Administration, what is wrong?

A: It looks like you are missing an administrativ account. 
   In newer versions of FusionDirectory you can simply re-run the setup and create 
    an admin account on the migration page. 

   Additionally you can set ignoreACL in FusionDirectory 1.0, just search the FAQ.
 

Q: The Unix's user's shell list is empty (unconfigured)

A: Just copy or link your /etc/shell in /etc/fusiondirectory.


Q: After upgrading FusionDirectory, the setup.php doesn't work or looks broken. 

A: You should delete all files in /var/spool/fusiondirectory

   |--> 
    # cd /var/spool/fusiondirectory
    # rm -rf *
   |<--


Q: After installing FusionDirectory using an existing LDAP tree, my user accounts are not listed.

A: You need to add the following objectClasses to your accounts:
  
   |--> 
    objectClass: person
    objectClass: organizationalPerson
   |<--

   The setup will automatically migrate those accounts, see migration step in FusionDirectory setup!


Q: Is it possible to login with the users mail address too? 

A: Yes, just add the following line to your fusiondirectory.conf:

   |--> 
   <location 
    ...
    loginAttribute="mail"
   |<--

   or for both, uid and mail:

   |--> 
   <location 
    ...
    loginAttribute="uid,mail"
   |<--
