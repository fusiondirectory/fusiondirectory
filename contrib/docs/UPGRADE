Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.8.9 to 1.0.9
=============================================

Backup you template First
=========================

The template system has been completely rewritten, and the old template will not be converted, so you need to backup them, remove them from FusionDirectory and then redo them.

The new system is much cleaner because template are stored in they own branch now and are the basis for having template for the whole application in the future.

Backup your phones
==================

You must backup all your phones in a LDIF and remove them.
Modify your LDIF like below:

Before
======

cn=namePhone,ou=phones,ou=systems,dc=labo,dc=opensides,dc=be
cn: namePhone
goFonType: friend
goFonDmtfMode: inband
goFonDefaultIP: dynamic
ipHostNumber: 127.0.0.1
macAddress: 00:0C:7F:31:33:F1
objectClass: top

After
=====

cn=namePhone,ou=phones,ou=systems
cn: namePhone
ipHostNumber: 127.0.0.1
macAddress: 00:0C:7F:31:33:F1
objectClass: fdPhone
objectClass: device
objectClass: ieee802Device
objectClass: ipHost

After the migration you may insert your phone again in your LDAP.

Moved Attributes
================

We cleaned the core of FusionDirectory to only used classical attributes and objectClass, so the FusionDirectory special attributes on the first page of FusionDirectory
are now managed by the personal plugin.

The personal plugin has been made to manage all kind of personal data and is best suited to contain those data not normalized.
So of you use personalTitle, dateOfBirth, gender you will need to install the personal plugin.

- Upgrade FusionDirectory first

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Removed obsolete plugins
========================

In this version we removed obsolete plugin, because they where based on software no longer existing
or needed an sql backend and we decided they need to be rewritten using the now ldap backend of those softwares :

asterisk : old plugin not maintainable anymore based on the sql backend, but now asterisk has an ldap backend has well.

fax : old code based on the gofax software from gonicus, not maintained anymore upstream.

openstack-compute : openstack management interface changed and this plugin is no longer relevant

uw-imap : long gone imap server, nobody that whe know still use it

They are no longer supported and should be removed from your installation

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-asterisk 

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-fax

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-openstack-compute

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-uwimap

New Plugin for peoples using a mix of groupOfNames and posixGroup on the same object
====================================================================================

We cleaned the code of FusionDirectory and by default it make posixGroup or clean standard compliant groupOfNames.
If you need a mix of groupOfNames and posixGroup on the same object you will need to install a new plugin called mixedgroups. 

! Please take note that this plugin is for special cases and need modified core schema. !

If you need to have a link between user and groups you are better using the standard compliant groupOfNames or roles for examples for web applications.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-plugin-mixedgroups 

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

List LDAP entries using deprecated attributes or objectclasses
cn=fusiondirectory,ou=configs,dc=fusiondirectory,dc=org contains an obsolete attribute
uid=fd-admin,ou=people,dc=fusiondirectory,dc=org uses the obsolete object class gosaAccount

fusiondirectory-setup --ldif-deprecated will output an ldif file on the console that you can use with ldapmodify to clean you ldap server from old attributes.
If they are old objectClasses it will warn you and you will have to remove it by hand, they have been specified at the fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated step.

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.9 to 1.0.9.1
=============================================

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- Upgrade the core template schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/template-fd.schema 

Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd.conf

Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP
==============================================================

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated

fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated will output a list of dn using old attributes and objectClasses

fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated
List LDAP entries using deprecated attributes or objectclasses
cn=fusiondirectory,ou=configs,dc=fusiondirectory,dc=org contains an obsolete attribute
uid=fd-admin,ou=people,dc=fusiondirectory,dc=org uses the obsolete object class gosaAccount

fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-users can help you migrate you user to the new core classes that are used by FusionDirectory. If they are attributes moved over to the personal plugin, 
it will automatically migrate them and you juste need to install the personal plugin

fusiondirectory-setup --ldif-deprecated will output an ldif file on the console that you can use with ldapmodify to clean you ldap server from old attributes.

If they are old objectClasses it will warn you and you will have to remove it by hand, they have been specified at the fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated step
at the exception of the gosaAccount class that is migrated with fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-users like mentioned above. 

Please read it carefully before applying !!


Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.9.1 to 1.0.9.2
===============================================

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Removed obsolete plugins
========================

In this version we removed obsolete plugin, because they where based on software no longer existing or needed an sql backend and we decided 
they need to be rewritten using the now ldap backend of those softwares :

rsyslog : old plugin not maintainable anymore based on the sql backend, and we don't want to manage sql backend in FusionDiretory anymore

database-connector : sql abstraction code no longer needed now that rsylog plugin is removed

They are no longer supported and should be removed from your installation

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-rsyslog

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-database-connector

==== Upgrade of LDAP directory ====

- Upgrade the core template schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema 

- if your are using the fusioninventory plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/inventory-fd.schema

- if your are using the supann plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/supann-fd.conf

==== Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory ====

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd.conf if they still exist

==== Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP ====

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated
