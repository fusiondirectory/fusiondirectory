==== Upgrade of LDAP directory ====

You have to update your LDAP schemas, first update the FusionDirectory core schemas. We have put a new option in fusiondirectory-insert-schema
that allow you to update easily your schema without the use of ldif files.

The following schemas needs an update :

  * core-fd-conf.schema 
  * mail-fd.schema
  * service-fd.schema
  * systems-fd-conf.schema
  * systems-fd.schema

<code>
fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd-conf.schema 
</code>

You must do the same procedure for all other schema needing an update
