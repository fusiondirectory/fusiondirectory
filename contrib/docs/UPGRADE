Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.8.9 to 1.0.9
=============================================

Backup you template First
=========================

The template system has been completely rewritten, and the old template will not be converted, so you need to backup them, remove them from FusionDirectory and then redo them.

The new system is much cleaner because template are stored in they own branch now and are the basis for having template for the whole application in the future.

Backup your phones
==================

You must backup all your phones in a LDIF and remove them.
Modify your LDIF like below:

Before
======

cn=namePhone,ou=phones,ou=systems,dc=labo,dc=opensides,dc=be
cn: namePhone
goFonType: friend
goFonDmtfMode: inband
goFonDefaultIP: dynamic
ipHostNumber: 127.0.0.1
macAddress: 00:0C:7F:31:33:F1
objectClass: top

After
=====

cn=namePhone,ou=phones,ou=systems
cn: namePhone
ipHostNumber: 127.0.0.1
macAddress: 00:0C:7F:31:33:F1
objectClass: fdPhone
objectClass: device
objectClass: ieee802Device
objectClass: ipHost

After the migration you may insert your phone again in your LDAP.

Moved Attributes
================

We cleaned the core of FusionDirectory to only used classical attributes and objectClass, so the FusionDirectory special attributes on the first page of FusionDirectory
are now managed by the personal plugin.

The personal plugin has been made to manage all kind of personal data and is best suited to contain those data not normalized.
So of you use personalTitle, dateOfBirth, gender you will need to install the personal plugin.

- Upgrade FusionDirectory first

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Removed obsolete plugins
========================

In this version we removed obsolete plugin, because they where based on software no longer existing
or needed an sql backend and we decided they need to be rewritten using the now ldap backend of those softwares :

asterisk : old plugin not maintainable anymore based on the sql backend, but now asterisk has an ldap backend has well.

fax : old code based on the gofax software from gonicus, not maintained anymore upstream.

openstack-compute : openstack management interface changed and this plugin is no longer relevant

uw-imap : long gone imap server, nobody that whe know still use it

They are no longer supported and should be removed from your installation

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-asterisk 

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-fax

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-openstack-compute

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-uwimap

New Plugin for peoples using a mix of groupOfNames and posixGroup on the same object
====================================================================================

We cleaned the code of FusionDirectory and by default it make posixGroup or clean standard compliant groupOfNames.
If you need a mix of groupOfNames and posixGroup on the same object you will need to install a new plugin called mixedgroups. 

! Please take note that this plugin is for special cases and need modified core schema. !

If you need to have a link between user and groups you are better using the standard compliant groupOfNames or roles for examples for web applications.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-plugin-mixedgroups 

Upgrade of LDAP directory

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.9 to 1.0.9.1
=============================================

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- Upgrade the core template schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/template-fd.schema 

Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd.conf

Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP
==============================================================

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated
List LDAP entries using deprecated attributes or objectclasses
cn=fusiondirectory,ou=configs,dc=fusiondirectory,dc=org contains an obsolete attribute
uid=fd-admin,ou=people,dc=fusiondirectory,dc=org uses the obsolete object class gosaAccount

fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-users can help you migrate you user to the new core classes that are used by FusionDirectory. If they are attributes moved over to the personal plugin, 
it will automatically migrate them and you juste need to install the personal plugin

fusiondirectory-setup --ldif-deprecated will output an ldif file on the console that you can use with ldapmodify to clean you ldap server from old attributes.

If they are old objectClasses it will warn you and you will have to remove it by hand, they have been specified at the fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated step
at the exception of the gosaAccount class that is migrated with fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-users like mentioned above.

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.9.1 to 1.0.9.2
===============================================

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Removed obsolete plugins
========================

In this version we removed obsolete plugin, because they where based on software no longer existing or needed an sql backend and we decided 
they need to be rewritten using the now ldap backend of those softwares :

rsyslog : old plugin not maintainable anymore based on the sql backend, and we don't want to manage sql backend in FusionDiretory anymore

database-connector : sql abstraction code no longer needed now that rsylog plugin is removed

They are no longer supported and should be removed from your installation

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-rsyslog

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-database-connector

==== Upgrade of LDAP directory ====

- Upgrade the core template schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema 

- if your are using the fusioninventory plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/inventory-fd.schema

- if your are using the supann plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/supann-fd.conf

==== Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory ====

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd.conf if they still exist

==== Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP ====

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.9.2 to 1.0.9.3
===============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================
 
Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories.

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- Upgrade the core configuration schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd-conf.schema

- if your are using the system plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/service-fd.schema

- if your are using the repository plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/repository.schema

Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove **recovery-fd.schema** and **asterisk-fd.conf** if they still exist

fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated will output a list of dn using old attributes and objectClasses of they are present in your ldap server

fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated
List LDAP entries using deprecated attributes or objectclasses
There are no entries in the LDAP using obsolete attributes
There are no entries in the LDAP using obsolete classes

fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-users can help you migrate you user to the new core classes that are used by FusionDirectory. 
If they are attributes moved over to the personal plugin, it will automatically migrate them and you juste need to install the personal plugin

fusiondirectory-setup --ldif-deprecated will output an ldif file on the console that you can use with ldapmodify to clean you ldap server from old attributes.

If they are old objectClasses it will warn you and you will have to remove it by hand, they have been specified at the fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated 
step at the exception of the gosaAccount class that is migrated with **fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-users** like mentioned above. 

Please read it carefully before applying !!


Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.9.3 to 1.0.10
==============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================

Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories 

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- Upgrade the core configuration schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd-conf.schema

- if your are using the personal plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/personal-fd.schema

- if your are using the system plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/systems-fd.schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/systems-fd-conf.schema 

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/service-fd.schema

- if your are using the dns plugin you have to update his schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/dns-fd-conf.schema 

and install a new schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/dns-fd.schema 

Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd-conf.schema if they still exist

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.10 to 1.0.11
=============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================

Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories 

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema


Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.11 to 1.0.12

Mail
====

In this version the mail plugin has been cleaned and his dependency to the systems has been removed. 
In the mean time the postfix and spamassassin service have been moved in their own plugins. The antivirus service have been removed.

The old spamassasin settings from the mail / user tab have been rewritten and moved to a spamassasin, they now support the real LDAP backend of spamassasin. 
So you will need to move your data to the new format before using them.

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- if your are using the mail plugin you have to update its schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/mail-fd.schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/mail-fd-conf.schema

- if your are using the system plugin you have to update its schemas

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/service-fd.schema

Postfix plugin
==============

- if you where using the postfix service in 1.0.11, you need to install the postfix plugin and insert the postfix schema

apt-get install fusiondirectory-plugin-postfix

apt-get install fusiondirectory-plugin-postfix-schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/postfix-fd.schema

Spamassasin plugin
==================

- if you where using the spamassin service in 1.0.11, you need to install the spamassassin plugin and insert the spamassasin schema

apt-get install fusiondirectory-plugin-spamassassin

apt-get install fusiondirectory-plugin-spamassassin-schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/spamassassin-fd.schema


Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd-conf.schema if they still exist

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.12 to 1.0.13
=============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================

Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories 

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- if your are using the alias plugin you have to update its schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/alias-fd.schema

Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd-conf.schema if they still exist

Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated
List deprecated attributes and objectclasses

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.13 to 1.0.14
=============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================

Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories 

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- if your are using the community plugin you have to update its schema 

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/community-fd.schema

- if your are using the systems plugin you have to update its schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/systems-fd.schema

Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd-conf.schema if they still exist

Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated

New Breezy Theme
================

In this version by default there is a new more modern theme called breezy. To active it completely go to the configuration plugin, click edit and in the "Look and feel" section select breezy

Enjoy :)


Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.14 to 1.0.15
=============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================

Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories 

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Plugin deprecated
=================

The apache2 plugin as been removed in this version

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-apache2

apt-get remove fusiondirectory-plugin-apache2-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- Upgrade the core template schema 

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd-conf.schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema

- if your are using the systems plugin you have to update its schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/systems-fd.schema

- if your are using the personal plugin you have to update its schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/personal-fd.schema

Remove old schema from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=======================================================

The old schema are not automatically removed from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.
You can safely remove recovery-fd.schema and asterisk-fd-conf.schema if they still exist

Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

fusiondirectory-setup --list-deprecated

fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated will output a list of dn using old attributes and objectClasses of they are present in your ldap server

fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated
List LDAP entries using deprecated attributes or objectclasses
There are no entries in the LDAP using obsolete attributes
There are no entries in the LDAP using obsolete classes

If you see the obsolete object class gotoPrinter you must run the next command and answer yes

fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-printers

fusiondirectory-setup --ldif-deprecated will output an ldif file on the console that you can use with ldapmodify to clean you ldap server from old attributes.

If they are old objectClasses it will warn you and you will have to remove it by hand, they have been specified at the fusiondirectory-setup --check-deprecated step.

!! Please read it carefully before applying !!

==== Hook ====

You must modify your hook so that they don't use quotes. The attributes are now automatically quotes and escape.

==== New Breezy Theme ====

In this version by default there is a new more modern theme called breezy. To active it completely go to the configuration plugin, click edit and in the "Look and feel" section select breezy


Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.15 to 1.0.16
=============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================

Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories 

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror


Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema


Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- Upgrade the core template schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd-conf.schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema


Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP
==============================================================

The --list-deprecated option of fusiondirectory-setup show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.16 to 1.0.17
=============================================

Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
=======================

Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu repositories 

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
=============================

- Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid dependencies errors:

apt-get install fusiondirectory

- Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema


Upgrade of LDAP directory
=========================

- Upgrade schemas

if your are using the fai plugin you have to update its schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/fai.schema

if your are using the dhcp plugin you have to install a new schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/dhcp-fd-conf.schema


Remove old ldif from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
=====================================================

We removed a default ldif from the ppolicy plugin, you can delete it
safely from /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/ppolicydefault.ldif


Check for deprecated attributes and objectClasses in your LDAP
==============================================================

The --list-deprecated option of fusiondirectory-setup show deprecated attributes and objectClasses for FusionDirectory

fusiondirectory-setup  --list-deprecated 
List deprecated attributes and objectclasses

- Upgrade the core schemas

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd-conf.schema

- if your are using the systems plugin you have to update its schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/service-fd.schema

fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/system-fd.schema
